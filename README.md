[VOLK][volk] is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a library that
contains kernels of hand-written SIMD code for different mathematical
operations. Since each SIMD architecture can be very different and no compiler
has yet come along to handle vectorization properly or highly efficiently, VOLK
approaches the problem differently.
